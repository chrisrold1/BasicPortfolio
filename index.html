        <p><img src="fbpic.jpg" class="align-left small" alt="me" />
            My name is <b>Chrisrold J senora</b>,i was born in this beautiful country name; <strong>Les Cayes Haiti.</strong>
            I came in this country at the age of 16 , in the years 2007.<br> At the time that i was there, i didn't know how to speak
            English , which make it so hard for me to learn some of the subject in school.When i was in high school, i will watch some dictionary word <br>and i will watch
            cartoon: Sponge Bob in other for me to learn how to speak Engish. At school i was afraid to speak English with my friends because my accent is strong , and i was
            afraid that they will laugh at me.
            <div> When i was In High school i will say that i want to be a web design , by the time i get to 12<sup>th</sup>grade i changed my mine goal to be a computer science. I went to <br>
                Oakton Community college, took some classes, while i'm taking these classes, i was browsing on the intertnet for a school that i won't have to take prerequiste classes.
